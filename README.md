### Weather Application using React

As a part of self study, I have worked on small and simple Weather cards to fetch weather by city and country using a third party API - [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api)

## Demo 

You can see the Demo here [Weather App](https://monikapatelit.github.io/weather-app/)

## Prerequisites
- I have used coding editor Visual studio code but you use any text editor
- [Download](https://nodejs.org/en/) Node.js and npm and follow installation steps
- Basic knowldge to create react boilerplate application to work on. Have a look the (tutorial by Gurjot Singh Makkar on Codeburst.io)[https://codeburst.io/deploy-react-to-github-pages-to-create-an-amazing-website-42d8b09cd4d] I like the most.


## Let's the fun begin

- Creat account on Open Weather API and ge the API to access the Json file. URL will look like this

```
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=${city},${country}&appid=${API_KEY}&units=metric
```
Where we pass the API to access json data file with city and country to get the perticular area weather data

# Two components 

- From component, to submit user event with city and contry details
- Weather component, to display weather details requested 

# Bootstraped

Tried to create responsive application using Boostrap 3.3.7
